# PIC10C_Assignment1_Ruotolo_Gianni
UCLA Pic 10c Assignment 1 Spring 2017

Contains three files that run a simple "siete y medio" game.
cards.h: a complete interface for the Card class plus templates for the Hand and Player interfaces.  
cards.cpp: complete implementation of the Card class that creates a random playing card.
siete_y_medio.cpp:  the main routine that runs the game.

This first assignment was meant to familiarize us with version control software.

More abut the rules to Siete y Medio:

"The traditional Spanish baraja is an old deck that was brought over by the Moors to Spain during the 14th century. The cards are still called naipes after the nƒÅ'ib cards found in the Mamluk deck... 

Smaller decks have 40 cards and lack ranks 8, 9 and comodines (jokers). The four suits are bastos (clubs), oros (literally "golds", that is, golden coins), copas (cups) and espadas (swords). The four suits are thought to represent the four social classes of the Middle Ages. The suit of coins represents the merchants, the clubs represents the peasants, the cups represent the church and the swords represent the military.

The three face cards of each suit have pictures similar to the jack, queen, and king in the French deck, and rank identically. They are the sota, which is similar to the jack/knave and generally depicts a page or squire, the caballo (knight, literally "horse"), and the rey (king) respectively.

At each round of play the player places a bet. After that, the player and the dealer each draw one card from the deck.The player is then repeatedly asked if another card is wanted. The player can continue to draw cards while the total is less than 71/2. After the player's turn is over, the dealer's cards are shown. The dealer's play is always the same: the dealer continues to draw cards only if the total is less than 7 1/2.

The value of every card doesn't always agree with the rank of the card. The values are listed in the following table:
Cards in 'siete y medio'
Name:	   As   	  Dos  	  Tres  	 Cuatro 	 Cinco 	  Seis  	 Siete 	  Sota  	Caballo	  Rey  
Rank:	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	10	11	12
Value: 	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	1/2	1/2	1/2

 the player starts with 100 pesos (or dollars) and the game ends when the player is down to 0 or when the dealer loses 900.
